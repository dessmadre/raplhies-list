#Ralphie's List

## Purpose

The purpose of this app was to create a catalog for vendors who use OfferUp as platform for selling thier goods. This app works by leveraging OfferUp's API which allows me access to all the products a seller has available. This app makes it easier for a seller to track thier inventory and can make it easier to show what they offer. The products can be filtered with the searchbar.

## Challenges

The most challenging part of this project was working with OfferUp's API, unfortuantely it is not public. In order to make the app display a sellers product, I have to to to a sellers page and get their product data from OfferUp everytime they updates thier merchandise. Nonetheless, I built the app and Ralphie's List is the catalog of my friend Ralph. Another challege was learing how to use filters and how I could filter the data on the page through the use of pagination and a searchbar,\n
